Custom Stickers Tutorial (courtesy of Mr.Yawnie)

For Custom stickers, you need to have a 72x72 PNG (preview image) and a 48 x 48 SVG vector graphic.

PNG instructions:

1. Create a 72x72 PNG with the image you want. Remember to have transparent background, or it will look odd.
2. Name the PNG with the sticker name you want to replace (found in twitter_emojis_png... folder)
3. Open the zip with 7-zip (do not extract!), and drag-and-drop the custom sticker in the zip while. Overwrite the existing png.
4. That's it for PNG for now.

SVG instructions:

1. Download Incscape from https://inkscape.org/en/download/ (or use any other vector editor)
2. Open the PNG you created with Incscape. Leave the settings as is (or change the "Image rendering mode" to "smooth" if you wish.
3. Go to File -> Save As and save the file as SVG.
4. Open the SVG file with Notepad++, and delete the the width and hight rows completely.
5. Under viewBox row, add the following line:
	style="enable-background:new 0 0 48 48;" 
6. Save the file, and open the SVG with a browser. If you see the image big and centered, it's ready for Snapchat.
7. Open the twitter_emojis_svg... folder with 7-zip, replace the existing svg with the custom one (should be named the same as the custom png!)
8. Close 7-zip. 

You have now added your custom PNG's and SVG's into the twitter_emoji zips. Now copy those zips to your phone in SD/Snapprefs/Stickers folder (in case you don't have it, create it!)

You have now successfully created and added your custom stickers into Snapchat with Snapprefs.
